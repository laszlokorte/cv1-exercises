# Computer Vision 1 Exercises

This repository contains my work on the computer vision course.

To run the code first install the dependencies:

```sh 
$ python -m pip install -r requirements.pip
```

Then run a single python file like
```sh
$ python sheet1/task1.py
```

Some tasks depend on downloaded datasets that are not included in this repository.
Make sure to download them first for example by running
```$
./sheet1/cifar-10-batches-py/download
```
