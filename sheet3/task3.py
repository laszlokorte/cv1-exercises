# QUESTION: The fraction of inliers in the data is Îµ, and m points are required to define a single model
# hypothesis. Prove that log(1-p) / log(1-e^m) =< k
# model hypothesis iterations are required for RANSAC to succeed with probability at least p
###

# In each iteration the probability of selecting ONLY inliers ist e^m. The Probability of NOT ONLY selecting inliers is (1-e^m).

# Each iteration is independent so NOT finding a selection of ONLY inliers after k iterations is: (1-e^m)^k.
# We call this a failure. We want this to happen with a probability lower than q:

# q >= (1-e^m)^k

# We call the probability that it does not happen p = (1-q)  <-> q = 1-p

# (1-p) >= (1-e^m)^k

# Now we resolve for k:

# log(1-p) >= log((1-e^m)^k)
# log(1-p) >= k * log(1-e^m)
# log(1-p) / log(1-e^m) =< k  # > inverts because the log is negative
