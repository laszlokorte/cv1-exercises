# Task 1

a) The dominant local direction of the keypoint is 45deg because the histogram shows the highest peak at 0.3 for the 45deg bin.

The value of the second largest 225deg bin is within (0.25/0.30 = 83%) the 80% threshold below the highest peak. But the next lower 135deg bin is not (0.20/0.30 = 66%).
That is why two keypoints are created: one for the dominant direction of 45deg and one for the second strongest direction of 225deg.
